This folders is for **data visualization**, since we know that there are many data visualization tools for data, from _python_ to _matlab_, from _R_ to other languages like _javascript_.


In chapter3, there mainly focus on the **matplotlib** library, but here for the future explore, we can go deeper and find these tools useful, which may takes us some time to play with:

	* seaborn (based on *matplotlib*)
	* D3.js ( *javascript* )
	* Bokeh ( *python*, like *D3.js* style's figure)
	* ggplot ( *python*, like *R* library *ggplot2*)
