NOTE
===

1. two ways for simplifying the importing schemes
	
	* Use the `import xxx as xxx` to simplify the name

			import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

	* Use some part of the module as `from xxx import xxx` to import **PART** of it

			from collections import defaultdict, Counter
	

2. Truiness or Falsy value

	* python use the following as the "Falsy" value
		+ False
		+ None
		+ 0/0.0
		+ [], {}
		+ "", set()


3. List comprehension

	* for in the list comprehension
	* multiple for in the comprehension
	* _ in the list meaning not wanting the value in the **list**

4. Pay attention to the advanced folders for high-level usage
