README
===

This serves as the complement for chapter4 **linear algebra**.


## Future work

* Linear Algebra, [from UC Davis](http://bit.ly/1ycOq96)
* Linear Algebra, [from Saint Michaelâ€™s College](http://bit.ly/1ycOpSF)
* If you are feeling adventurous, [Linear Algebra Done Wrong](http://bit.ly/1ycOt4W) is a more
advanced introduction
* All of the machinery we built here you get for free if you use [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org). (You get a lot more too.)


## Tools

For this part, if we want to use the tools well to calculate the linear lagebra, or we want to practice, just use the **Numpy**.
