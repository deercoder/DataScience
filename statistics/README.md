This part serves as the complement materials for **statistics**.


## Future work

Read at least one book on statistics like linear algebra, there are some options:

	* [OpenIntro Statistics](http://bit.ly/1L2GKvG)

	* [OpenStax Introductory Statistics](http://bit.ly/1L2GJrM)

## Tools

There're a lot of functions that use statistics in **Scipy**, **pandas** and **StatsModels**.

Make full use of them, at least try some of them to be familiar with their API, the first two are very common in some deep learning framework, so just be a master in this area

## Remark

In this part, the theory is more important than practice, so just keep in mind that read **at least** one book about **statistics** for future work.
