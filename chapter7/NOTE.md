NOTE

1. For a real-world problem, the data science problem can be concluded as a hypothesis, which means that we can use a hypothesis to judge a problem set. By default, the problem is the `H_0`, that is the default case; and we have another case that it's `H_1`, we want to compare the later one with the previous one.

    * for example, we want to judge whether a coin is fair, say the probability of landing head is p, then our null hypothesis(or default hypothesis) is `H_0`, and its probability is 0.5, so the `H_0` means that p = 0.5, and the alternative hypothesis is p != 0.5
