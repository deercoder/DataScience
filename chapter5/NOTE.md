## Simpson's paradox

If we only looks at the data, maybe we will get some opposite result. In the book there is an example that looks like the western data scientists are more friendly than the eastern data scientists. However, when taking the degree into account, that the eastern data scientists with PhD degree are more friendly than the western data scientists.

In our real world, it's not easy to do it first. We have to really _know your data_


## future

We should also know that even for the value of correlation, it's unknown that they'r totally unrelated, because mybe the data they have has some forms of relation, that will result in the zero. This is a just extreame example, but for our own analysis, we should know and check for this kind of data.
